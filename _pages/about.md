**Welcome!**

I am a 4th-year Ph.D. Student in Health Data Science, and a member of [Cognitive AI Lab](https://cair.umn.edu/) at UMN. I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Serguei Pakhomov](https://www.pharmacy.umn.edu/our-faculty-staff/our-faculty/serguei-pakhomov). I received B.S. in Agricultural Science at Zhejiang University in 2017 (advised by Prof. Jun Zhu) and M.S. in Biostatistics at Duke University in 2019 (advised by Prof. [Benjamin Goldstein](https://sites.duke.edu/bgoldstein/)).

My current research interests include *Natural Language Processing* and *Trustworthy Machine Learning*. My on-going projects specifically focus on developing methodologies to ensure **fairness** and **robustness** of machine learning and deep learning models and their application in **healthcare**. This involves addressing the presence of sensitive features or confounding shifts that may interfere with model performances. Besides, I am also interested in designing methods for probing **Large Language Models (LLM)** to assess the faithfulness of language generation and adapting it for downstream domain-specific tasks.
